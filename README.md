# ðŸ§  Natural Language Processing (NLP) Repository  

Welcome to the **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** repository! This repository is designed to store and update various NLP tasks, projects, and learning resources over time. Whether you're working on text processing, sentiment analysis, or advanced deep learning models, this repository will serve as a valuable reference.  

## ðŸ—‚ Repository Structure  

The repository is organized into the following folders:  

- **Tasks**: Contains different NLP tasks and their implementations.  
- **Datasets**: Sample datasets used for training and evaluation.  
- **Models**: Pre-trained and custom-built NLP models.  
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks with experiments and explanations.  
- **Utilities**: Scripts for text preprocessing, data cleaning, and evaluation.  

## ðŸ”§ Technologies and Tools Used  

This repository primarily focuses on:  

- **Python**: The core programming language for NLP tasks.  
- **NLTK**: For traditional NLP techniques like tokenization and stemming.  
- **spaCy**: For fast and efficient NLP processing.  
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For modern deep learning-based NLP models.  
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: For training neural network-based NLP models.  
- **Scikit-learn**: For classical machine learning-based NLP tasks.  

## ðŸ“š NLP Tasks  

This section will be updated as new tasks are added. Some planned topics include:  

- **Text Preprocessing** (tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stopword removal)  
- **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**  
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**  
- **Text Classification** (spam detection, sentiment analysis, topic modeling)  
- **Machine Translation**  
- **Question Answering Systems**  
- **Text Summarization**  
- **Speech-to-Text & Text-to-Speech**  
- **Conversational AI (Chatbots & Virtual Assistants)**
